<br>
I have also pursued online courses in Data Science and Machine Learning from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), where I learned to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data using popular libraries like `` pandas ``, `` NumPy ``, `` Matplotlib ``, `` Seaborn ``, and `` Scikit-learn ``. In addition, I gained knowledge of prepossessing techniques, feature engineering, model selection, model validation, hyper-parameter tuning, and transfer learning through the Machine Learning Scientist with Python track. I have also explored working with text data using `` NLTK `` and `` SpaCy `` and image data using `` Keras ``, as well as implementing distributed data management and machine learning with `` PySpark ``.

# Projects
 
## Web Scraping DataCamp Website [[LINK]](https://github.com/musirikasrinivas/Data_Camp_Plus-DSP):
The project was focused on designing and developing a content management system for data science learning. The team utilized Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine instances to create a JupyterHub environment, which was then integrated with Canvas LMS and its Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) features.
 <br>
 
 **Libraries:** `` urllib ``, `` Requests ``, `` bs4(BeautifulSoup) ``, `` Selenium ``, `` re(Regular Expressions) ``
 
## Data Visualization (Bar Chart Racing) [[LINK]](https://flourish-user-preview.com/641778/rQzafjQRqfMCkaSQ4EJjT3PX-FlWd9LPk4j_IwQk5nOnE3WMERHa77GKnlwaSaUj/):
This project aimed at generating code to extract raw data from various sources related to the performance of ICC ODI, Test, and T20 cricket matches. The data was collected by scraping the ESPN website and further cleaned and manipulated using pandas for generating the desired CSV files. These CSV files were then used for visualizing the data through a flourish visualization tool. The visualizations were in the form of racing bar charts that helped to gain insights into the performance of the teams in batting, bowling, and fielding. The project was successful in presenting the performance data in a meaningful and easy-to-understand format, providing valuable insights into the performance of the teams.
 <br>
 
 **Libraries & Tools:**  `` Numpy ``, `` Pandas ``, `` Matplotlib ``, `` Seaborn ``, `` urllib ``, `` Requests ``, `` bs4(BeautifulSoup) ``, `` re(Regular Expressions) ``, `` Flourish tool ``

## Check Truncation System [[LINK]]( https://github.com/musirikasrinivas/CTS):
The project aimed at automating the check truncation process in the banking industry. The focus was on developing a system that can accurately detect the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) code and segment the handwritten text present on checks. The Check Truncation System (CTS) was designed and developed to achieve this objective. The project involved the use of advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and extract the required information from the scanned images of checks. The successful implementation of the CTS is expected to bring efficiency and accuracy in the check truncation process, saving time and reducing manual errors.
